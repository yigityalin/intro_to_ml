All the implemented functions and classes are documented and have example usages in the notebook file. The classes are implemented in a similar way to popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Also, the notebook file is explained using markdowns.

PCA class has fit, transform and inverse_transform methods to fit the data, to apply PCA on data using k principle components, and to transform the data to the original space, respectively. More details can be found in the docstrings, and example usage can be found in the notebook.

LogisticRegression class has fit, __call__ and predict methods to fit the data, to predict the positive class probabilities given a batch of data, and to predict the classes given a batch of data, respectively. More details can be found in docstrings, and example usage can be found in the notebook.
